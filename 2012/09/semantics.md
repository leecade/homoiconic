Semantics
=========

To the layman, the structure of programming languages map to the structure of spoken languages loosely, if at all. Identifiers seem to map to nouns and verbs, and then it gets muddled. Is `&&` a verb or a conjunction? Is `function` an adjective or punctuation? Programming "languages" seem to exist in a reality of their own, more mathematical notation than language in the human sense.
