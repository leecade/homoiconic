Some writing about writing "raganwald"
===

When I was writing [raganwald.com](http://raganwald.com), I kept a list of ideas for blog posts. That way, when I needed to write a post and I didn't have any inspiration, I could go to my list and write something. Why, you may ask, did I do this? Why didn't I simply write a post when I had an idea, and not write a post when I didn't have an idea?

The answer, of course, is that I had heard that writing on a schedule is important for building an audience. If you have four ideas one day, you shouldn't write four posts on that day, you should spread them out. And if you don't have an idea on a particular day, you should write a post anyways, that's how you build an audience. Or so the story goes. That's what Jeff Atwood seems to do, and it works for him.

I don't write that way. All of my very best posts were written shortly after an idea came to me. None of the "I'll save this for later" ideas turned out to matter very much. I would get an idea, write about it, polish and rewrite it (often long after it was first published)

This shouldn't surprise anyone. Yesterday would have been Patrick McGoohan's 81st birthday. At one time, he was the most highly paid actor on Television in the world. But he is remembered today for two quirky things. First, he starred in [Ice Station Zebra](http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4519277/Ice_Station_Zebra-AC3-5.1-DVDRip[Eng]1968.avi), a movie Howard Hughes watched over and over, obsessively, while holed up in his penthouse. In those days you needed your own projector and the film was on big spools you'd thread by hand, the whole idea of watching movies at home hadn't been branded piracy before the movie studios were dragged unwillingly into making billions of dollars of the business (see also: [thepiratebay.org](http://thepiratebay.org/ "Download music, movies, games, software! The Pirate Bay - The world's largest BitTorrent tracker")).

McGoohan also created and starred in [The Prisoner](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FOQ03C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=raganwald001-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FOQ03C "Amazon.com: The Prisoner - Complete Series Megaset (40th Anniversary Edition): Patrick McGoohan: Movies &amp; TV"), a cult classic TV series. The word "series" is a real stretch, he only made seventeen episodes. Actually, he only made seven real episodes, the other ten were "fillers" created to make the show fit how the networks wanted to sell television entertainment.

For those of you who didn't know this, seven of the episodes contain key character development for the protagonist, Number Six. Furthermore, the seven in question were intended to be shown in a different order than how things eventually were broadcast. If you are keen on this stuff, try watching the seven in the following order:

1. Arrival
2. Free for All
3. Dance of the Dead
4. Checkmate
5. The Chimes of Big Ben (Alternate Version from teh DVD box set, if possible)
6. Once Upon a Time
7. Fall Out

Diluting your most original ideas to fit other people's preconceived prejudices of how a medium should operate. Does this sound familiar? Well, anyways, here I am with no particular ideas for a post and I thought I'd raid my collection. Only I'm dressing it up with some vainglorious attempt at insight by breaking the fourth wall and talking about how much the process sucks.
