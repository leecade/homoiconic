Revides.revised(Ruby.rewrite(Ruby))
===

Recently I had the honour of sharing a few of my thoughts at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/ "Stack Overflow")'s Dev Days in Toronto. Joel Spolsky  emailed and suggested that my Ruby.rewrite(Ruby) talk would be interesting. I wouldn't normally re-present the same ideas twice, and that talk was a very specific call-to-action for the Ruby community, so it was easy for both of us to agree that I revise my presentation.

As it happens, I ended up with an almost entirely different presentation. What they had in common was the [conceit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceit "Conceit - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") of ever "slide" being a legal snippet of Ruby code, and the general topic of meta-programming. (I sincerely hope I am using the word "conceit" properly.)

I'm writing today to share some of my ideas in writing for those who weren't there but are interested in what I was trying to say, and for those who were there and want a recapitulation. I am going to touch on a few of the ideas I was trying to share, giving each their own little chunk of prose. Although on stage I tried to link everything together in an overarching presentation, I think in print they can stand alone. And can be read in any order.

The most important thing I am asking you to do is to **Think about Thinking about Programming**. Programming may sometimes seem like a [clerk's job](http://raganwald.com/2008/01/no-disrespect.html "No Disrespect"). But whether you are writing tests for loan state flow or writing infrastructure to distribute computation across thousands of machines, you are engaging almost all of the planning and analysis and problem solving parts of our brains that make us human, that distinguish us from other organisms on this planet.

Thinking about programming is being human. And thus "thinking about thinking about programming" is examining what makes us human and why. I am about to explain why studying programming languages is a very fruitful way of thinking about what makes us human, but I really think that all areas of thinking about programming are interesting ways to think about being human. Debating BDUF vs. Agile methodologies is really a way of analyzing human behaviour. Debating the organization of components and modules into an architecture is a way of discussing the way our minds make sense of complicated things. 

And my own passion, the study of programming languages is more than just the study of making efficient tools. Programming languages are used to describe a solution in a very concrete, tangible way for the benefit of the computer. So in that way studying languages is a way of studying how we think about solutions to problems. Programming languages are also used to describe solutions to other programmers or domain experts. So in that way studying languages is a way of studying how we think about communicating solutions to problems.

Do you ever do this thing where you are puzzling over a problem, and a colleague asks you what's going on, and when you start to explain it the act of communicating the problem somehow opens up an insight and you solve it even as you're explaining it? There's something very important that goes on in our brains when we explain something. Programming languages are a notation for explaining what we are thinking, and the act of explaining leads us to insights.

So studying programming languages is a way of studying how we think about programming, and therefore when you think about languages, you are thinking about thinking about programming. And in turn, that strikes me as being a way to think about thinking, to think about part of what makes us human. I think that's worthwhile.

    :abstractions? or 
      :linguistics?

My entire discussion defining "meta-linguistic programming," discussing program language semantics, and comparing linguistics to abstractions originally appeared here as [Meta-Linguistic Programming](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2009-10-08/metalinguistic.md).

[Meta-Linguistic Programming](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2009-10-08/metalinguistic.md) ends with a section called "Abstractioneering," and I re-presented this basic idea during the talk as well.
