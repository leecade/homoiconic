I Make Dreams Come True
===

> Visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else’s dreams?—Orson Welles in the film "Ed Wood"

Recently, I read [Don't Call Yourself a Programmer][1]. Right away, I'm going to say that in my nearly thirty years of experience turning software into money, just about everything Patrick says about the business of software and how to get ahead is absolutely true. Sure, you can quibble with something or other. After all, getting ahead in business is a huge subject and this is an essay. Something has to be overgeneralized or insufficiently explained, that's the nature of trying to cram a very large number of bits of information into a fixed size container.

But if I could send messages back in time, "Don’t Call Yourself a Programmer" contains a lot of the stuff I would want to tell a young Mr. Braithwaite. There are some other things I'd want to tell myself. One of them is, I'm not in the "programming" business, or the "adding value to the economy" business. I program and add value, but my motivation for programming and for finding ways to add value is that those are the ways I finance my real business, which is **the making dreams come true business**.

Consider movies. Sure, there are incredible documentaries. And moving, gritty, realistic dramas. But many great movies have a dream-like quality to them. I don't mean the movies *depict* dreaming, that's often too much. But movies like [Amelie][2] have a dream-like feeling, something that connects with us in a deep way, something that takes us out of where we are and places us in the past, future, or parallel reality. Something that breaks the laws of physics or society.

Such movies aren't just about what the filmmakers were dreaming, they connect with us because they're a realization of *our* dreams. Filmmakers make dreams come true. Just like me: I make dreams come true. And I don't just mean, I make *my* dreams come true. I mean, I write software that makes its users' dreams come true.

**The Dream Feeling**

The idea that films realize dreams applies to software, whether it's software with a visual look and feel or it's a new programming notation or perhaps a library that makes you think about doing an old thing in a new way. Great software and great programming languages have a dream-like quality. Learning to use them has this strange feeling of needing to relearn everything you know while simultaneously feeling so natural that you are filled with wonder but not dissonance.

I want that from the software I build. If it doesn't change the way its users think, what damn good is it? When someone uses my software or programs with one of my libraries, I want "Aha!" I want "Of course it works this way, why did everyone screw this up before?" I want "Now that you've given it to me, you can have it back when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers."

As a user, I had this experience looking at a Macintosh in 1985. The GUI seems obvious today, but to someone who hadn't seen [The Mother of all Demos][10], or hadn't followed what PARC was up to, the illusion of direct manipulation and WYSIWYG was like being in a dream. It had that quality of being so different from everything I'd seen before but somehow connecting deeply with how things ought to be so that it wasn't alien.

Speaking of drawing things, when I started to learn object-oriented programming, I bought a book that walked me step-by-step through writing a vector drawing program using Object Pascal. I won't say that Objects were an Aha! for me: I grokked the style and my response leaned towards "Oh, fine, that's how we'll do it." Polymorphism was more of a "Neat-o" than an "I must be dreaming." To this day, I'm [reserved][6] [about][7] [OOP][8]. But something else blew my mind: The book explained how to implement an Undo Stack using what is now called the [Command Pattern][9].

When I figured out what was going on, my mind immediately told me that I wasn't in Kansas any more. Here I was thinking about programs as basically being a collection of data types and some procedures and functions operating on those data types. OOP reorganized the data types and functions, but it wasn't a huge leap of thought, you still operated with data types and functions. But Commands were something new: Now the idea of changing the data was a piece of data itself. To this day, the Command Pattern feels very related to the essential idea of Lisp's equivalence between programs and data, to the idea of a programmable programming language, to the idea of functions operating on functions and not just on data. It felt like the basic laws of physics were disrupted, like someone had shown Newton the two slit experiment or general relativity.

Did I just talk about the Command Pattern? I went to the first Startup School. Naturally, I could tell you about seeing Woz in person or some such, but do you know what blew my mind? Seeing a crowd of people use [SubEthaEdit][5] to take notes. Collaborative editing was another dream-like feature, something which made me feel like I was in an alternate reality where software and operating systems worked on an entirely different basis. Collaborative editing takes the Command Pattern and runs it through an algorithm called [Operational Transformation][11] and out comes magic: people around the world editing a document like a spreadsheet or a program in real time.

Now that I have seen Operational Transformation, I can't help but thinking that all of the CRUD software I'm writing is Doing It Wrong, that nearly everything ought to be live and in real time and collaborative. That every web program should be manipulating commands or edits or whatever you want to call them, that undo and collaboration and a list of who did what should all be basic and baked into the architecture. Once again, everything is different, yet somehow feels like it's always been this way and I simply didn't see it before, like my mind was clouded in my waking state and I had to dream to see the way things ought to be.

And now that I've dreamt in colour, I don't want to wake up and have to live my life in black and white.

**The Business of Dreams**

I strongly suspect that most people will either agree or disagree with my feelings at a visceral level. It's a little like [invention][12], you probably have some deep-seated attraction to the idea of inventing new things or a perfectly healthy aversion to going down the rabbit hole when you could be getting things done with the tools and processes that already exist.

So I'm not going to tell you that you are going to be taller, more attractive, or make more money if you try to make dreams come true. I can tell you that there is money to be made in the dreams business. You know how I don't want to wake up from my dreams? People are just  the same. Raise your hand if you want to give up your GUI and do everything on the command line. Or if you think phones should be tethered to a twisted pair of copper wires.

Okay, three people who are reading this within Emacs raised their hands. Congratulations, retro-grouches. Everyone else in the world is addicted to GUIs and watching a movie on a tablet and collaboratively editing a spreadsheet. Once you show someone a dream and let them live in it for a moment, they don't want to leave. Dreams are habit-forming. Dreaming is addictive. And if you make dreams, your business is supplying dreams to people who never want to give them up.

That's a powerful business model. Use it wisely.
